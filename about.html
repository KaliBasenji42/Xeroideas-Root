  <p>
    I am college student with a love for nature and science. I am going to college for an engineering degree, specifically nuclear engineering. Also, I love coding, and have many of my projects hosted on a sub-domain of this website (<a href="https://kalibasenji.xeroideas.org" target="_blank">kalibasenji.xeroideas.org</a>).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Nuclear and quantum physics describe how the universe works, which has always fascinated me. And with my passion for the outdoors, makes me a strong advocate of nuclear energy. My love for the outdoors can by explained by my time in Boy Scouts of America (BSA). BSA has taught me to many outdoor and leadership skill, and has helped me help others.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    My pursuit of engineering is from a similar curiosity to that of nuclear. I enjoy thinking of the mechanics of almost anything. And I was able to do this in <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/" target="_blank">FRC</a> and an engineering trade school. I learned (and got certified) in SolidWorks.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    My passion for coding also bleed into a passion of computer systems. So I learned enough networking, with a lot of help from Cameron, to host this website on a Raspberry Pi. I also learned how to operate Linux based systems, and use NixOS on my main system.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In addition to nature, nuclear, engineering, coding, and computer systems, I also have hobbies in photography, pixel art, and writing.
